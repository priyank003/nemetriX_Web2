Devlok has been a wonderful opportunity for us to learn some Web-Development skills.

Harsimrat(me) and Nikhil got to learn some React during Devlok. We also got to learn some basics of nodejs and express, even though we failed to implement express in our website nicely. We got to learn some advanced Javascript while learning react and express. 

Priyank got to polish his React knowledge as this project was more complex than what he had worked on before Devlok. He also got to learn Redux and some basics of backend development. Devlok Mentors helped him whenever he asked for their help.
